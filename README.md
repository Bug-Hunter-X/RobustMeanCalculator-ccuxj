This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to the handling of NA (Not Available) values when calculating the mean of a numeric vector. The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code, which fails to properly address NA values before calculating the mean. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected version of the code that demonstrates the correct way to handle NA values using the `na.rm` argument in the `mean()` function.
